# Swashteroids
_An example using the Swash framework_

[Swashteroids](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/swashteroids/id6472061502) is a game I made with the ECS framework [Swash](https://github.com/johnrnyquist/Swash) along with some SpriteKit. Get it in the App Store!

Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM2IAM2pBCY) of the gameplay.
